# LeetCodeCardArray

On a computer, Arrays can hold up to N items. The value of N is decided by you, the programmer, at the time you create the Array. This is the same as when we found a big enough cardboard box for the DVDs. Additionally, you also need to specify the type of item that will be going into the Array.

In Java, we use the following code to create an Array to hold up to 15 DVDs. Note that we've also included a simple definition of a DVD for clarity.
